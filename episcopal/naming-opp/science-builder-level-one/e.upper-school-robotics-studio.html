<p class="big colorMD">
    Mechanics, electronics, and code come together to create complex interactions and interesting problems in the Upper School Robotics Lab. Students use the engineering design process to create robots that can detect an obstacle, follow a line, identify a color, or retrieve an object. In the process, they learn the importance of clear communication, targeted problem-solving, and effective teamwork.
