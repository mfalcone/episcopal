 The nest that a homeroom classroom creates for children is the essence of a Lower School experience.  This space is the home away from home and the nucleus of our studentâ€™s academic day.  The configuration of these classroom maximizes collaboration, and the design allows teachers to open up to the neighborhood as students need to spread out.  This space is one of the essential components to the makeup of the Lower School as it provides the safety and security of home base from which they can then connect with the greater grade, the school, the neighborhood, and the world.
