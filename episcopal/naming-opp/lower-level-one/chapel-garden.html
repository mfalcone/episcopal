 The serenity and reflective nature of our Lower School chapel services are reinforced by the outdoor space adjacent to the Chapel.  This space is decidedly different from the learning terraces that provide direct access to the outdoors from classrooms -- different both in vegetation and in purpose.  Teaching children to reflect and look inward beyond the explicit instruction of a chapel service is an important part of the ESD experience, and this garden is a dedicated space to fertilize this inclination.
