 When our community shares a meal together, we are learning important lessons about fellowship and manners.  The tables are round by design, reinforcing connectivity and conversation between children. When not in use as the dining commons, this large room easily transforms into an acoustically-treated auditorium space that seats the entire Lower School for shared performances of grade level musicals, awards ceremonies, parent meetings or visiting authors.
