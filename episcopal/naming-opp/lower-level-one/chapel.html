 Daily Chapel is one of ESD's Founding Tenets, and it remains a central component of each studentâ€™s day.  Built across the green from All Saints Chapel, this space serves as the centerpiece of the Lower School building, connecting the Early Childhood and Elementary Wings. Our new Lower School Chapel will allow us to gather the entire Lower School at once. When we have affirmed our faith and given thanks for God's grace, we will go forth to do the work God has given us to do: to learn and teach.
