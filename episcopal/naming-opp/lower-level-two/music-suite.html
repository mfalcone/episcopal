 The Music Suite provides a place for inspiration and exploration of sound and senses.  Children will create and develop their imaginations by using their voices and instruments to make music.  Children will have opportunities for fine and gross motor development with a variety of rhythm and movement activities. In this suite, young children, who are just beginning to discover their ability to soar like an eagle, dance with the flowers, sing for the pure joy of hearing their own voices, or pretend to gallop swiftly like a pony, will have a safe place where they can explore all the possibilities their bodies, minds, and voices for musical and bodily-kinesthetic development.
