ESD’s commitment to the arts is clear, as demonstrated by the emphasis on Fine Arts’ Night and FAN. The creation of a dedicated space that supports instruction in a wide array of media is essential as children begin to discover their talents and interests.  The Artist's’ Studio provides space to sculpt, paint, draw, create textiles, and much more. Its close proximity to the other enrichment studios affords a hub of creative energy for the myriad talents of our students.
