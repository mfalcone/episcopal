 This flexible, collaborative space affords students the opportunity to engineer and tinker while capturing the imagination, sparking creativity, and inspiring teamwork and problem-solving.  Akin to the design studios at Stanford’s Design School, this multi-purpose space is equipped with furniture that affords unique set-up based on the challenge set before the class.  The furniture is easily moved and the room well-stocked with supplies and equipment that allows students to “make” as wildly as their minds allow.  One might climb the community staircase to find a class working on a Rube Goldberg chain reaction, or creating a stop-motion animated video about the life of Marie Curie, or creating robots that can pick up and move an object.  A large garage-sized door in the science lab connects the two spaces for optimal exploration.
