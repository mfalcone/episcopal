 This is a space for inspiration, movement, and exploration of sound and senses.  Students will develop their voices and learn to use them as another instrument in their artistic toolbox.  With plenty of room for instruments and dance, they will experiment with rhythm and explore the way movement communicates to an audience.  Students will develop the musical cognitive processes that lay the foundation for future thinking and perceptual organization.
