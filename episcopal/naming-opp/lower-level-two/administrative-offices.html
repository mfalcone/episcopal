<p class="big colorMD">
 Offices housing members of the Lower School Leadership Team and the administrative support staff are sprinkled throughout the building with a few key members of this group centered conveniently at the entrance to maximize communication and teamwork.   The Lower School Operations Coordinator and Administrative Assistant are connected closely to the Head of Lower School, while the Assistant Head of Lower School is enmeshed in the Elementary Discovery Commons and the Early Childhood Coordinator centrally located with the students and staff she supervises.  This creates the ideal spread of administration throughout the space to connect with students, parents, faculty and prospective families.
