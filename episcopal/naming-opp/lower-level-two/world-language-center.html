 Becoming genuinely conversant in a world language lies at the heart of our program and teaching with comprehensible, compelling, and contextual input allows young students to learn much like they learned English -- through storytelling and conversation.  This World Language Center functions as a classroom and lab hybrid that allows students to hear and practice high-frequency Spanish verbs and vocabulary in active and meaningful ways.
