 Creation of a science lab sized especially for our youngest learners is a key ingredient in teaching children to think of themselves as scientists.  It is important that they have tools and materials right-sized for them as they begin to dissect and engineer the world around them.  The space supplies the materials, freedom and supportive culture to ask questions, to think about procedures and equipment, to investigate and conclude based on unbiased rational judgment and to go wherever the evidence leads.
