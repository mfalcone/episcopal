 The value of an ESD education is our focus on the individual needs of each child in our care.  Not all students learn in the same way, and we strive to meet each child where he or she is, celebrating his or her unique gifts and talents while moving towards full potential.  When children bump up against an academic obstacle, trained learning support educators are in place to help them find success.  The Language Lab allows small group and one-on-one coursework to support non-traditional learners.  Certified Academic Language Therapists meet with students daily to facilitate reading instruction, and learning specialists meet here several times a week to remediate curriculum or help students learn the compensatory strategies that will allow them to soar.
