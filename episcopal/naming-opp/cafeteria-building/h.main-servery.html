    The Main Servery includes four hot-and-cold serving stations. With a larger capacity than our current servery, it will reduce the amount of time required to serve students, giving them a longer period of time for dining.  The Main Servery will be the hub of the renovated Dining Hall, serving over 1,000 faculty and students each day.
