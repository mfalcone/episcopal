The Upper Lobby flows directly from the Grand Staircase. The light-filled, open space gracefully ushers students and parents into the balcony seating in the Proscenium Theater and the Dance/Choral Hall. With built-in benches and views into the Grand Lobby below, the Upper Lobby will serve as a gathering space and an additional performance area for students.
