    The Concession and Box Office sits elegantly at the intersection of the Grand Lobby and the Main Gallery, with low walls giving the space a modern, accessible feel.  With its central location, the location will serve as a hub of activity during the fall play, the spring musical, concerts, dance performances and other community events.
