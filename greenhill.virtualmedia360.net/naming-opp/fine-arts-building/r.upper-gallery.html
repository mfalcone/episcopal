    The Upper Gallery will feature the works of talented student and faculty artists, serving as a source of inspiration for all that traverse this main passageway on the upper level of The Marshall Family Performing Arts Center. Students will use the Upper Gallery to access the Video Classroom and Editing Lab, upstairs dressing room, and back of house access to the Auditorium.
