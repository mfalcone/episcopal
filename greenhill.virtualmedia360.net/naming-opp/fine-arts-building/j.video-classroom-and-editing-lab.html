<h3>Video Classroom and Editing Lab (Reserved)</h3>
<p class="big colorMD">
The video production program continues to earn numerous prizes in national film competitions despite current space limitations, and many of our students pursue these studies in college and beyond. With additional space and banks of computers offering the latest in film editing technology, the new Video Production Classroom and Editing Lab will provide a space where students will craft and share stories through the screen. The space will also offer a fixed projection screen and surround sound to offer an optimal movie viewing experience.
