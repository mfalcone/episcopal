<h3>Kitchen, $500,000</h3>
<p class="big colorMD">
    The Kitchen, the soul of the Dining Hall and Student Center, will include an updated layout, improving workflow and capacity.  New equipment, including a hearth oven, will expand the culinary options available for on campus events ranging from breakfasts to intimate lunches to three-course dinners in the Grand Lobby of The Marshall Family Performing Arts Center.  In addition to on-campus catering, the Kitchen will continue to make and serve nearly 1,500 lunches for students and faculty each day.
