Central to Greenhill’s campus on the Foote Quadrangle, Crossman Hall has served many functions over the school’s history.  Now, the existing building including the Zale-Fields Theatre spaces will be reformulated to house a state of the art cafeteria and student common space, enhanced Buzz Bookstore and Head of School’s private dining room.  The impact on the day-to-day operation is equal in significance to the New Assembly and Performing Arts Hall.
